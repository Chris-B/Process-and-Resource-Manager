# Process-and-Resource-Manager

A system with data structures to represent processes and resources as well as operations invoked by processes to manipulate other processes or to request/release various resources. Includes operations that emulate the actions of hardware interrupts. Tested with a shell emulating hardware that accepts commands typed in by the user, and will invoke the corresponding function of the manager.
